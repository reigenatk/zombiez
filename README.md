# ZOMBIE FOREST 

### Description

I play a lot of games. Some of them so much that I started to wonder: why not learn how to make them? After learning about game engines I decided to have a go at it myself.
After all, games have quite a bit of coding involved so I might learn something along the way.

For 3D engines, the most commonly used are [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/). I decided to choose Unity as it has a massive support forum and some of my favorite games ever (Hollow Knight, RimWorld, Subnautica) are made using unity! 
For my project I decided to try my hand at making a classical zombie survival game, kinda like Call of Duty Black Ops.
It was surprisingly challenging, and through the process I learned a lot.

Gather guns and ammo during the day...

  And survive at night... Don't run out of power!

Here's [a video](https://youtu.be/hNiEe156eHM) of me playing

Through this project I learned how to use things like:
- the Start and Update methods and how to use them
- making an FPS controller
- how to make animations using keyframes
- Unity 3D tools like Terrain/NavMeshAgent
- Unity Canvas for UI such as pause/start menus
- Implementing a Day/Night cycle
- use ProGrids/ProBuilder to make houses
- the difference between prefabs and instances
- C# scripting / classes
- and most importantly... debugging by reading Unity Documentation!


Big shoutout to [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA), I must've watched at least 10 of his videos for my project. 
Also I took a udemy course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/), I can recommend it although I skipped some portions, the parts that I did do were very good.

I have only added the script files so you can see some of the code that I wrote. This was the bulk of the work for my project. The game itself was much too big to commit to GitHub
so you can download it [here](https://reigenatk.itch.io/zombiez)
